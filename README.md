# Open Targets Genetics
This repo may eventually become a web application to display genetics data for Open Targets. Right now, it's preliminary thoughts on UX and architectural decisions.

## Visualisation templates
The *ux/visualisation templates* directory contains brief summaries of known standard representations for different types of data. Hopefully if we collate these as a pattern library, we can start to derive the eventual web application navigation.

* [Manhattan plot](ux/visualisation-templates/manhattan-plot.md)
* PheWAS plot
* Linkage disequilibrium plot
* Triple box plot
* Observed vs expected deviation plot
* Volcano plot
* eQTL punchcard plot
